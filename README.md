# YoutubeStats_Analysis
Hello everyone! 👋 I'm thrilled to share my project, 'YoutubeStats_Analysis,' a fantastic exploration of YouTube data using various tools. Starting with Excel and Python, I focused on cleaning up messy data, fixing errors, and making everything look friendly and organized.

Then, I got into the nitty-gritty of data analysis using SQL's RMF technique. It helped me group YouTube channels based on how often they upload, how recent their content is, and how well they do financially. It's like organizing a bunch of puzzle pieces into clear categories.

The icing on the cake was using Tableau for visualizations. I created excellent charts and graphs that make the data easy to understand. You can see trends, like which types of channels are doing well, and even interact with the visuals.

My GitHub repository is like a diary of my journey. I've documented everything from fixing data mishaps to creating visual magic with Tableau. If you're just starting in data analysis or curious about YouTube insights, my project is a great place to learn and explore. Come join me in decoding the world of YouTube data!" 📊📁
